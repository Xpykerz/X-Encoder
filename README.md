# X-Encoder

X-Encoder is a versatile tool designed for encoding and decoding text using Base64 encoding. Developed by @Xpykerz, this tool is tailored for pentesters and programmers. It is written in Python and is compatible with Linux, Windows, and Android platforms.

## About Base64 Encoding

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that converts binary data into an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data. This means three 8-bit bytes (a total of 24 bits) can be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits.

## Features
- Encode and decode text using Base64.
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, Android).
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and run X-Encoder:

### On Linux
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt install python
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/Xpykerz/X-Encoder.git
cd X-Encoder
chmod +x X-Encoder.py
python X-Encoder.py
```
> **Note:** If you encounter any errors, try running the script with `python2` instead of `python`.
